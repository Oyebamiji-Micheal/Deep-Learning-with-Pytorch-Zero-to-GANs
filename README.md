## What this repository is all about
<p align="justify">
    Contrary to what you might think, this repo is not some course for someone looking to get into data science or deep learning. In fact, it is solely for myself. This repository is dedicated to keeping track of my progress with respect to deep learning only! Though this might take a long time but my intention is to take an holistic approach to deep learning - implement algorithms from scratch, understand the mathematical intuition behind most deep learning algorithms and build exciting projects along this way.

<br />

## Principle-oriented and Hands-on Approach
<p align="justify">
    To have a solid understanding of the core principles of neural networks and deep learning as well as a strong hands-on problem solving experience, this repo will be in two sections. The first will be heavily motivated towards understanding the core concepts which will involve fairly large amount of linear algebra and calculus while the second section will be more of the coding aspect.

## Hands-on
| S/N   |   Title   |   Description     |
|:-----:|:---------:|:-----------------:|
|   1   | [Fundamentals of Pytorch](#) | Introduction to Tensors \| Creating Tensors \| Tensor Operations |
|   2   | [Gradient Descent and Linear Regression with Pytorch](#) |  How gradient descent algorithm works \|  Training a Linear Regression model from scratch \|
