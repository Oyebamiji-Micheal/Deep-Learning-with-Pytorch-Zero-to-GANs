## What this repository is all about
<p align="justify">
    Contrary to what you might think, this repo is not some course for someone looking to get into data science or deep learning. In fact, it is solely for myself. This repository is dedicated to keeping track of my progress with respect to deep learning only! Though this might take a long time but my intention is to take an holistic approach to deep learning - implement algorithms from scratch, understand the mathematical intuition behind most deep learning algorithms and build exciting projects along this way.
